# phylomoments

This R package implements a simulation-free dynamic programming algorithm for 
calculating higher-order moments of stochastic mapping summaries on a 
phylogeny. Utility functions related to simulation-based stochastic mapping 
and continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) are also provided.

Please see the vignettes for some examples of using the functions provided in this package.
